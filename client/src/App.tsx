        <Paragraph>
          Just like in Tic-Tac-Toe, your goal is to get 3 of your shape in a
          row. Unlike in Tic-Tac-Toe, the grid has 4 rows and columns, and there
          are 3 shapesâ€”one for each player.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Each player takes turns clicking or tapping an empty square on the
          grid to place their shape. The first player to get 3 in a row wins.

        <H3 class="mt-8">Compensate for your lack of friends</H3>

        <Paragraph>
          If you don't have 2 friends to play against, you can set one or more
          players to be controlled by the computer. Use the switches under Play
          against computer to select which players the computer controls.

        <Paragraph>
          Be warned: The computer knows all the best stategies and plays to win.
