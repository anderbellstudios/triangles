        <Paragraph>
          Just like in Tic-Tac-Toe, your goal is to get{' '}
          <strong>3 of your shape in a row</strong>. Unlike in Tic-Tac-Toe, the
          grid has <strong>4 rows and columns</strong>, and there are{' '}
          <strong>3 shapes</strong>â€”one for each player.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Each player takes turns clicking or tapping an empty square on the
          grid to place their shape. The first player to get{' '}
          <strong>3 in a row wins</strong>.

        <H3 class="mt-8">Play online</H3>

        <Paragraph>
          You can play locally with people in the same room as you, or you can{' '}
          <strong>play online</strong> over the internet. To play online, press{' '}
          <strong>Host game</strong>, choose a game ID, and press{' '}
          <strong>Create game</strong>.

        <Paragraph>
          Other players can join your game by pressing{' '}
          <strong>Join game</strong> and entering the game ID, or you can press{' '}
          <strong>Copy link</strong> and send them a URL to join automatically.

        <H3 class="mt-8">Compensate for your lack of friends</H3>

        <Paragraph>
          If you <strong>don't have 2 friends</strong> to play against, you can
          set one or more players to be{' '}
          <strong>controlled by the computer</strong>. Use the switches under{' '}
          <strong>Play against computer</strong> to select which players the
          computer controls.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Be warned: The computer knows all the <strong>best stategies</strong>{' '}
          and plays to win. If you can beat the computer{' '}
          <strong>more than 33% of the time</strong>, you're a{' '}
